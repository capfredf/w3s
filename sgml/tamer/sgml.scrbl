@handbook-title/pkg-desc[]

@margin-note{Using @tt{xml} as the library name will conflict with other libraries in the realm of
 Racket, and I neither want to add a prefix @tt{typed-} to it, hence the @|the-name|. In the future,
 there would be another @tt{sgml/html} as well.}

The @the-name is a typed XML parsing library which originally designed for my @racketmodname[svg]
engine. That is, this library itself is not adequate for dealing with XML sources that used as data
models.

Meanwhile, @the-name will:

@itemlist[
 @item{provide a sort of APIs to read and deal with the @tech{XML document}, with or without tokens
  information.}
  
 @item{provide a Racket language @litchar{#lang sgml/xml} for embedding @tech{XML document}s in compiled
  files, as well as hightlighting XML files.}
